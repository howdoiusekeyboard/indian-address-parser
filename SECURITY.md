## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately rather than opening a public issue.

**How to report:**
1. Email the maintainers with details of the vulnerability
2. Include steps to reproduce if possible
3. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

**What to expect:**
- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Status update within 7 days
- Fix timeline depends on severity

**Disclosure:**
- We follow coordinated disclosure practices
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless anonymity is preferred)
- Public disclosure after a fix is available
